# Chemistry
An AI-generated web page containing various data.

The JSON files in this project were all created using OpenAI to collect this data and generate these JSON objects from this data.
The HTML, CSS and Javascript are almost completely generated by the AI, including most of the texts. The only thing I've specified are the names Fanny and Fiona Foxboom. 
With some additional fine-tuning, I could let the AI generate a whole webpage with some simple functionality, even though I could have just written it myself.
This is a project where I will likely use more AI to generate more interesting functions.
